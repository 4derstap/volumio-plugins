#       Volumio Onkyo Control Plugin

(Hopefully) A simple plugin that is able to turn an Onkyo receiver on the network on and off when playback begins and ends using eISCP.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement power on when starting playback
- [ ] Implement power off when stopping playback (Optional? If not resumed after X seconds?)
- [ ] Config options (IP / Port with defaults, power off time, output channel)
- [ ] Discover receivers on the network for config option drop down
- [ ] Change receiver to "Line 1" channel (or configured option) after power on
