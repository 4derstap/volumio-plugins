#       Volumio Onkyo Control Plugin

(Hopefully) A simple plugin that is able to turn an Onkyo receiver on the network on and off when playback begins and ends using eISCP.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement power on when starting playback
- [ ] Implement power off when stopping playback
- [ ] Config options
- [ ] Discover receivers on the network for config option drop down
- [ ] Change receiver to "Line 1" channel (or configured option) after power on
